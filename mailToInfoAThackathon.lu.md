Dear Hackathon.lu Team,

We at Level2 are saddened by the fact that the Hackathon can't take place and have collectively decided to provide an alternative for your initial participants.

As we understand there are only two dozen people registered which would be a rather ideal fit for our Hackerspace.

If you would be so kind and share the following link with the people registered:

https://level2.lu/h4ackathon.txt

As you can read in the text we want to support the community by providing a quick alternative to the initially planned event.

Even if it is not as big and quite frankly prestigious as your event we know that together as a community we can help each other out.
Your team, time and logistics permitting, would have done the same for us.

We would be really happy if you shared this with the teams/individuals registered so they can have a good time nevertheless.

As we want to have a win-win situation, please let us know if we should integrate anything you planned for your event.

Perhaps a Technoport/Fablab Roll-up, or other materials to show that this is a community effort.

Feel free to call me directly if you have any questions, doubts, or need clarification: +352 691 20 33 66

Sincerely yours,

Steve Clement
