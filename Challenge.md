The time has come… to have some phun.

Sooooo, we want to extend the challenge by providing some nice data sets you can get creative with.

When we think data, we lust for computer readable *stuff*

But the real world teaches us on tough lesson every-time we get eager to distil that funky data source only to realize that it is a PDF or even worse a low quality image file with some data already visualized.

Below we have a heat-map of the pollution levels in Luxembourg City.
Very valuable data but no real way to extract anything from it.

Your task could be to come up with the heatmap2text parser.

Geeks are everywhere and we have taken over the world ever since Grace Hopper wrote her first line of, errr… punch cards.
One geek niche is the beautifully confusing realm of TimeZones.

For the *nix folks, more specifically the sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade adventurers, there is a recurring theme in how frequent the package *tzdata* gets updated.

From countries who have a 30 minute time zone offset to countries who have frequent brawls about daytime savings time, every single weirdness has been meticulously documented by the TZ geeks.

The following dataset has it all. It is a text file, but that makes it not necessarily very parsable or useful for the rest of us.

Take a deep breath and look at what is inside. Does it make music? Is there a hidden message? What do all the current time zones look like in the most esoteric diagram you know?

Play with it. You have all the creative liberties on this one. May it be an interactive tzdata map, or an audio generator.

Time zone data can be art, oh wait, there is even an FTP location with examples :D
